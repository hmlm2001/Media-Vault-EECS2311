## Description
MediaVault is a software application with the main purpose of storing a collection of media, and allowing users to keep track of their progress in them. 

## Initializing the Database
The MediaVault database must be initialized using MySQL before running the main application.
To initialize the database, run the **SETUP.sql** script (located in MediaVault/database) with the root MySQL user.

## Switching to Stub
