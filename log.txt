- Created the base UML diagram for the project
- Started implementing classes and testing functionality.

Task Assignments + Estimates
GENERAL: Everyone works on extensive JUnit test cases for their classes.
- Isaac: Create the abstract Media class to store media information and a 
movie class to extend it (6 days).
- Herman: Create the User class to store the user's username and media 
list as well as the MediaCollection class to store a list of the user's 
media. (6 days).
- Mate: Create login and encryption classes to allow users create an 
account and login to it safely (9 days).
- Ruth: Create a UI for the Account Creation and Login (9 days).

- How we should approach putting together the project prior to deadline
- Managed to get everyone's git connections working and sarted making appropriate classes and package

Task Assignments + Estimates
GENERAL: Reallocated tasks and updated estimates
Login & Encryption: Mate (4 days)
Media and MediaCollection: Muhammad (4 days)
LoginUI: Isaac (6 days)
User & Allmedia: Ruth (4 days)
Test Cases: Lim (4 days)

The deadline for all team members to complete their allocated tasks is Wednesday Feb 15th.

Mate Progress:
Feb 11th-13th:
	Compelted classes Login.java, Encryption.java and LoginDB.java. Testing required to fully implement desired fucntionality. Overall time taken is about 3 days. The class Login.java is used by the UI classes to verify login or to create an account. The login.java class uses the Encryption.java class to encrypt the password and username then pass it onto LoginDB which will store or verify the provided encrypted data.
Feb 14th:
	Fixed some issues with LoginDB.java where the string comparison was done incorrectly.
Feb 15th:
	Met with team and discussed project. Login encryption and access sucessfully linked together with LoginUI to be able to successfully login with existing users. (You would still have to create it first as there are no existing users due to the static natrue of the classes)
	
Isaac's Progress:
Feb 12th:
	Started working on the user interface with LoginUI.java and SignUpUI.java. Created fields as appropriate and basic validation checks for logging in and signing up.
Feb 13th:
	Created Explore.java to act as a temporary explore page for the application. Successful account creation/log in redirects to the explore page.
Feb 15th:
	Met with team and arranged classes into appropriate layers (packages). Successfully inked Login.java to LoginUI.java and SignUp.java to connect the backend with the UI.
	
Ruth's Progress:
Feb 12th:
	Created AllMedia and User classes with mostly  skeleton code.
Feb 13th:
	added stub database of movies and implemented reading from file and the rest of the methods for AllMedia and User classes
	Tested object creation and read from file.
Feb 15:
	added case insensitivity to the search function of all media. remains to be tested.
	
Muhammad's Progress: 
Feb 13th: 
	completd the AllMedia and media collection code.
Feb 15th:
	helped with creating the stub database
	
Progress as of 15 February:
	All parts of the iteration 1 requirements have been completed. Now just need a day to properly connect them all and write appropriate test cases.
	Time estimates were mostly accurate. All members contributed and managed to do their assigned tasks.
	In today's meeting we talked about the way to submit the iteration 1 required parts, and decided to meet tomorrow (Feb 16th) at around 8:40pm when it is convinient for everyone. The README.md file has been updated to give a fresher and more accurate description of the project as well as the way to launch the project.
